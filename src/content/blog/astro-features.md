# Powerful Features of Astro

Astro is a modern static site generator designed for building fast, content-driven websites.

## Core Features

### 1. Islands Architecture

Astro uses a unique islands architecture that only loads JavaScript when needed:

\`\`\`astro
---
// Server-side code
const posts = await getCollection('blog');
---

<div>
  {posts.map(post => (
    <article>
      <h2>{post.data.title}</h2>
      <p>{post.data.description}</p>
    </article>
  ))}
</div>
\`\`\`

### 2. Multi-Framework Support

You can use different UI frameworks in the same project:

- React
- Vue
- Svelte
- Solid
- Preact

### 3. Content Collections

Powerful content management system with type safety:

\`\`\`ts
const blog = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    publishedAt: z.coerce.date(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
});
\`\`\`
